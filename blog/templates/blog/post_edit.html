<!-- POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.POST is used to insert/update remote data.When we submit the form, we are brought back to the same view, but this time we have some more data in request, more specifically in request.POST (the naming has nothing to do with a blog "post"; it's to do with the fact that we're "posting" data). Remember how in the HTML file, our <form> definition had the variable method="POST"? All the fields from the form are now in request.POST. -->
